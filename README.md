This analysis is an exploratory data analysis- it intends to uncover any trends or noteworthy aspects of the dataset. 
We begin by observing the general time trend, aswell as the variance over time.
We then attempt to group the years by their degree of variance, first we attempt a simply visual split. 
Next we attempt a more computational sepration, using ANOVA, then Scheffe Grouping, to get periods of "plateaus" in rates.
We then attempt to fit a distribution over the rates of the last two years, using a truncated weibull and truncated exponential. We carry out a hypothesis test, to evaluate the goodness of fit.
We move onto fitting a time series onto the rates, since this is more fitting given the type data.
We then evaluate the model fitted and forecast.
